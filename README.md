# ShmativeRecord

ShmactiveRecord is an experimental object-relational mapping implementing the
active record design pattern. It was created in November 2014 while I was attending
[App Academy](http://www.appacademy.io/). I wrote the program using test-driven development,
and split the project into 4 phases (each with their own set of tests).

It has all of the most common methods used in Ruby on Rails-flavored version of ActiveRecord,
including *all*, *save*, *update*, *find*, *find_by_id*, and the *has_many*,
*has_one*, *belongs_to*, and *has_many_through* associations.
